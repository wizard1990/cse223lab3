<a name="user-content-lab3" class="anchor" href="#lab3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lab3</h2>

<p>Welcome to Lab3. The goal of this lab is to take the bin storage that
we implemented in Lab2 and make it fault-tolerant.</p>

<p>Lab3 can be submitted in teams of up to 3 people.</p>

<p>Not many changes, only some small things, should be painless.</p>

<p>It does not come with more unit tests (because it is not very easy to
cleanly spawn and kill processes in unit tests). You need to test by
yourself with <code>bins-*</code> tools.</p>

<a name="user-content-system-scale-and-failure-model" class="anchor" href="#system-scale-and-failure-model"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Scale and Failure Model</h2>

<p>There could be up to 300 back-ends. Back-ends may join and leave at
will, but at any time there will be at least 1 back-end online. Also,
you can assume that each back-end join/leave event will have a time
interval of 30 seconds in between, and this time duration will be
enough for you to migrate storage.</p>

<p>There will be at least 3 and up to 10 keepers. Keepers may join and
leave at will, but at any time there will be at least 1 keeper online.
Also, you can assume that each keeper join/leave event will have a
time interval of 1 minute in between. When it says "leave" here, it
assumes that the process of the back-end or the keeper is killed;
everything in that process will be lost.  Each time the keeper comes
back at the same <code>Index</code>, although all states are lost, it will get a
new <code>Id</code> field in the <code>KeeperConfig</code> structure.</p>

<p>For starting, we will start at least one back-end, and then at least one
keeper. After the keeper sends <code>true</code> to the <code>Ready</code> channel, a
front-end may now start and issue <code>BinStorage</code> calls.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-consistency-model" class="anchor" href="#consistency-model"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consistency Model</h2>

<p>To tolerate failures, you have to save the data of each key on
multiple places, and we will have a slightly relaxed consistency
model. </p>

<p><code>Clock()</code> and the key-value interface calles (<code>Set()</code>, <code>Get()</code> and
<code>Keys()</code>) will remain the same semantics.</p>

<p>When concurrent <code>ListAppend()</code> happens, when calling <code>ListGet()</code>, the
caller might see the values that are currently being added appear in
arbitrary order. However, after all the concurrent <code>ListAppend()</code>'s
successfully returned, <code>ListGet()</code> should always return the list with
a consistent order.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an valid call and return sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially, the list <code>"k"</code> is empty.</li>
<li>A invokes <code>ListAppend("k", "a")</code>
</li>
<li>B invokes <code>ListAppend("k", "b")</code>
</li>
<li>C calls <code>ListGet("k")</code> and gets <code>["b"]</code>, note that how <code>"b"</code> appears
first in the list here.</li>
<li>D calls <code>ListGet("k")</code> and gets <code>["a", "b"]</code>, note that although
<code>"b"</code> appears first in time, it appears at the second position in
the list.</li>
<li>A's <code>ListAppend()</code> call returns</li>
<li>B's <code>ListAppend()</code> call returns</li>
<li>C calls <code>ListGet("k")</code> again and gets <code>["a", "b"]</code>
</li>
<li>D calls <code>ListGet("k")</code> again and gets <code>["a", "b"]</code>
</li>
</ul><p><code>ListRemove()</code> removes all matched values that are appended into
the list in the past, and sets the <code>n</code> field propoerly.
When (and only when) concurrent <code>ListRemove()</code> on the same key and 
value is called, it is okay to double count on <code>n</code>.</p>

<p><code>ListKeys()</code> remains the same semantics.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-entry-functions" class="anchor" href="#entry-functions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Entry Functions</h2>

<p>The entry functions will remain exactly the same as they are in Lab2,
but only that the <code>KeeperConfig</code> might now have multiple keepers.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-additional-assumptions" class="anchor" href="#additional-assumptions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>No network error; when a TCP connection is lost (RPC client
returning <code>ErrShutdown</code>), you can assume that the RPC server
crashed.</li>
<li>When a bin-client, back-end, or keeper is killed, all data in that
process will be lost; nothing will be carried over a respawn.</li>
<li>It will take less than 20 seconds to read all data stored on a
back-end and write it to another back-end.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-requirement" class="anchor" href="#requirement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirement</h2>

<ul>
<li>If at all times, there will always be at least 3 back-ends online
(might be different three ones at any moment in time), there should
be no data loss.</li>
<li>Key-value storage call always returns without an error, even when a
node and/or a keeper just joined or left.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-building-hints" class="anchor" href="#building-hints"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Hints</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can use the logging technique to store everything (in lists on
the back-ends, even for values).</li>
<li>You need to replicate each piece of data.</li>
<li>Let the keeper(s) keep track on the status of all the nodes, and do
the data migration when a back-end joins or leaves.</li>
<li>Keepers should also keep track on the status of each other.</li>
</ul><p>For the ease of debugging, you can maintain some log messages (by
using <code>log</code> package, or by writing to a TCP socket or a log file).
However, for the convenience of grading, please turn them off by
default when you turn in your code.</p>

<p>Also, try use a machine different than c08-11 for testing and debugging,
this will lower your probability of running into a port collision.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-turning-in" class="anchor" href="#turning-in"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Turning In</h2>

<p>If you are submitting as a team, please create a file called
<code>teammates</code> under the root of <code>triblab</code> repo that lists the login ids
of the members of your team in each line.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have committed every piece of your code (and the
<code>teammates</code> file) into the repository <code>triblab</code>. Then just type 
<code>make turnin-lab3</code> under the root of your repository. It will generate a
<code>turnin.zip</code> that contains everything in your gitt repo, and will then
copy the zip file to a place where only the lab instructors can read.</p>
